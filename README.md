# UBLOX_ZED_F9P_UBX_Protocol_Driver

### I have successfully analyzed the UBX protocol and message creation logic for the UBLOX ZED-F9P GNSS module. Using the F9P-Interface Description, I wrote a configuration driver in C.

#### SerialCom.h and SerialCom.c: These files contain auxiliary communication tools and the necessary functions to send messages to the GNSS module. 
#### Driver.h and Driver.c: These source and header files are created to handle various operations such as forming and sending messages using the UBX protocol. They make up the configuration file.
